Nightfever is an international community of young Christians from about 100 cities all over the world. In these cities they open churches during the night and invite passersby to a moment of tranquility and encounter.
Currently there are websites for some of the cities, mostly from german speaking areas. These websites run on the same system but there are hardly any interconnections besides a general city navigation list.
The online services for nightfever are to be renewed in terms of design as well as the underlying software system. The most important reasons for this and some of the challenges are:

* internationalization and localization
* dynamic content
* support for mobile and touch devices
* increased usability for viewers and editors

As a project for the course Design Interaktiver Systeme in Theorie und Praxis the scope is to design a concept for navigation of the public webpages on nightfever.org.

Individual websites/landing pages and subsites:

* international landing page (multilingual): nightfever.org
* landing pages for cities (usually monolingual, some with 2 or more languages): ~100 cities atm (e.g. bamberg.nightfever.org)
* landing pages for specific projects, recurring events etc. (mono- or multilingual)
* landing pages for countries or regions (usually monolingual, some with 2 or more languages)

All these websites have some sub pages like articles, events and static pages.

The navigation concept should include
* switching between different localizations of the current page (if available)
* show related entities of a certain site (city -> country, event -> city)
* show the total amount of cities and projects
* nearby nightfever cities
* upcoming events in nearby cities
