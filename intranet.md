# File Hosting
We need a dropbox-like service to host files and share them within Nightfever teams.

##Current Situation
As a quick and dirty solution we are currently using owncloud on a uberspace. Uberspace is not intended as a storage provider for large amounts of data, the maximum space is limited to 10GB.
