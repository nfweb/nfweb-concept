#Core Concepts
* one web page, one language (```<html lang="#{lang}">```)
* the language is identified by an url component
* the content of a web page may be available in other languages
* variations of a page in other languages must be accessible from that page
* cookies or browser settings may only affect generic (landing) pages and result in a redirect to a language-specific url: ```nightfever.org``` -> ```nightfever.org/de```
* separate content and navigation

#URL Structure
Every site has a default language. If a site has a major default language the language identifier may be omitted.

```:lang``` language identifier

* ISO 639-1 codes (de, en, es etc.) [List on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)
* ISO 639-2 codes if there exists no code in ISO 639-1
* no regional/dialect differentiation (locales)

```:site``` site identifier

* local sites: koeln, fulda, new-york
* regional sites:
 * two-letter country code as defined by ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 [List on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1)
 * corresponds with contry code top-level domain (ccTLD)
 * uk vs. gb: ISO 3166-1 code for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is ```gb```, but the ccTLD is ```uk```. **Suggestion**: preference for ```uk```, ```gb``` as redirect

```:query``` path (cf. [urls.md](urls.md))

 * query paths are translated (```/en/history``` = ```/de/geschichte``` = ```/pt/hist√≥ria```)

**Challenge**: country codes and language codes may be confused.
A possible solution would be using ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 three-letter country codes (deu, fra, gbr) to establish a different scheme than language codes.

##Language Identificytion by Subpath
```(:site.)nightfever.org/:lang/:query ``` 

##Others (not recommended)
* Language Identificytion by URL parameter: ```(:site.)nightfever.org/:query(?lang=:lang)```
* Language Identificytion by Subdomain: ``` (:lang.)(:site.)nightfever.org/:query ```
 * requires second-level subdomains (not supported by SSL wildcard certificates)
* Language Identificytion by Country Code Top-Level Domain (ccTLD): ```(:site.)nightfever.:ccTLD/:query```

#Design Implications
* **Fonts** must support special characters for all used languages
* **Font sizes** need to be adaptable for non-latin characters
* **Word lengths*** differ, this requiers a flexible navigation
